### Dataset Overview

My chosen dataset is the voting distribution of Baseball Cy Young candidates. It
includes the final outcome of the voting, via a point system, along with the major
sabermetric statistics that measure a pitcher's performance throughout the year.
I will obtaining the dataset from
[Baseball Reference](https://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/awards_2021.shtml#AL_CYA_voting_link).
It allows downloading a csv file for each year's candidates, I will have to combine them
into one data matrix. This site also has more pitching data which I can add as 
additional predictor variables. The amount of observations is dependent on the
year I begin collecting voting data from, this could range from the 1960s to the
early 2000s. As we get closer to modern day, the statistics used to quantify a 
pitcher's performance has gotten more advanced, so the earlier voting data
may not be relevant today. The amount of predictors is also variable, as I can
add as many as I see fit. The type of predictor variables I will be working with 
will be entirely quantitative. The response variable will most likely be 
quantitative as well. I could either make the response quantitative for how many
points each pitcher will recieve, or simply make it categorical, as yes/no for
the winner. There is no missing data from what I have seen, but if I do come upon
any I can simply replace that variable with another, since there are an endless 
number of pitching statistics to choose from.
